automation using python 
A python script which will open the link of the class using class name given by the user. 

To get the user input, I have decided to make a simple batch script which will take the input from the command prompt and pass it to our python script. 

Our python script can do things like printing the classes today, opening the class link and showing the present session. I have automated the whole script which makes this script so special.
